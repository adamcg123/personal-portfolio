          Hi my name is Adam, I am 19 years old and I graduated from a full stack web developing boot camp that was from the University Of Minnesota. I'm a decently quick learner and I get along well with others and I am looking forward to being taught new things also I'm currently looking for work in this field and I made this page to show some of my work.
